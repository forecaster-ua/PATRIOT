### Business Model
- **Hedge Fund Operations**: Users delegate trading authority through API key provisioning
- **Centralized Strategy Management**: Administrative control over trading strategies and risk parameters
- **Revenue Model**: Monthly percentage-based fees from account balance growth
- **Multi-Exchange Support**: Binance Futures (primary), Bybit (secondary), with extensible architecture

### Key Stakeholders
- **End Users**: Individual traders providing API access for automated trading
- **System Administrators**: Technical staff managing system operations and strategies
- **Fund Managers**: Business stakeholders overseeing trading performance and risk
- **Compliance Officers**: Regulatory oversight and audit trail management
