# PATRIOT Trading System - Production Architecture Documentation

## 📋 Document Overview

**Project:** PATRIOT Trading System - Multi-User Production Architecture  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** September 2025  
**Authors:** Solution Architecture Team  
**Scope:** Complete system redesign from single-user MVP to production-ready multi-user hedge fund platform

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

The PATRIOT trading system transformation involves migrating from a single-user MVP to a production-ready multi-user hedge fund platform capable of managing 100+ user accounts across multiple cryptocurrency exchanges. The system implements a hedge fund model where users provide API access and the platform manages their trading accounts through centralized strategies.

### Key Business Objectives
- **Scalable Multi-User Platform**: Support 100+ concurrent users with individual account management
- **Hedge Fund Operating Model**: Centralized strategy management with user account delegation
- **Multi-Exchange Integration**: Binance Futures and Bybit with extensible architecture
- **Administrative Control**: Comprehensive management tools for system operations
- **Revenue Generation**: Monthly percentage-based fees from account balance growth

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI), Docker, Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL
- **Architecture Patterns**: CQRS, Event-Driven, Microservices
- **Security**: JWT, API Gateway (Kong), encrypted API key storage
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, structured logging
