## ADR-001: CQRS Pattern Implementation

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: September 2025  
**Deciders**: Solution Architecture Team  

### Context
The PATRIOT system needs to handle both high-volume read operations (portfolio queries, analytics) and critical write operations (order placement, risk management) with different performance characteristics and scalability requirements.

### Decision
Implement Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern to separate read and write operations into distinct services and data models.

### Alternatives Considered

#### Option A: Traditional CRUD Architecture
```
Pros:
- Simpler to implement and understand
- Single data model reduces complexity
- Fewer moving parts

Cons:
- Read and write operations compete for resources
- Difficult to optimize for different access patterns
- Single point of failure and bottleneck
- Harder to scale reads and writes independently
```

#### Option B: CQRS with Shared Database
```
Pros:
- Separation of read/write logic
- Single database reduces operational complexity
- ACID consistency maintained

Cons:
- Database still shared bottleneck
- Limited ability to optimize read models
- Harder to scale independently
```

#### Option C: Full CQRS with Event Sourcing (Selected)
```
Pros:
- Complete separation of concerns
- Independent scaling of read/write sides
- Optimized read models for different query patterns
- Complete audit trail through events
- Ability to replay events for debugging/recovery

Cons:
- Higher complexity
- Eventual consistency model
- More infrastructure components
```

### Decision Rationale

**Primary Factors**:
1. **Scalability Requirements**: Need to handle 100+ concurrent users with different read/write patterns
2. **Performance Optimization**: Read queries (portfolio, analytics) have different requirements than write operations (orders)
3. **Audit Requirements**: Financial system requires complete audit trail
4. **Future Extensibility**: Easy to add new read models for different business needs

**Technical Benefits**:
- **Independent Scaling**: Read services can scale horizontally based on query load
- **Optimized Data Models**: Read models optimized for specific query patterns
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Natural fit for real-time trading system
- **Fault Isolation**: Read side failures don't affect write operations

### Implementation Strategy

```python
# Command Side (Write)
class OrderCommandService:
    async def create_order(self, command: CreateOrderCommand):
        # Validate command
        # Execute business logic
        # Persist to write database
        # Publish events
        
# Query Side (Read)  
class PortfolioQueryService:
    async def get_portfolio(self, user_id: UUID):
        # Query optimized read model
        # Return projected data
```

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Independent deployment and scaling
- Optimized performance for different use cases
- Complete audit trail through events
- Easier to maintain and evolve

**Negative**:
- Increased system complexity
- Eventual consistency between read/write sides
- More infrastructure components to manage
- Learning curve for development team

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Comprehensive documentation and training
- Automated testing for eventual consistency scenarios
- Monitoring and alerting for read/write synchronization
- Clear guidelines for handling consistency requirements

## ADR-002: Database Technology Selection

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: September 2025  
**Deciders**: Solution Architecture Team, Database Team  

### Context
The system requires both transactional data storage (OLTP) and time-series data storage (OLAP) for historical performance tracking and analytics.

### Decision
Use **PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension** as the primary database solution for both transactional and time-series data.

### Alternatives Considered

#### Option A: PostgreSQL + InfluxDB (Dual Database)
```
Architecture:
- PostgreSQL for transactional data (users, orders, accounts)
- InfluxDB for time-series data (prices, performance, metrics)

Pros:
- Purpose-built time-series database
- Excellent compression and query performance for time-series
- Native time-series functions

Cons:
- Two different database systems to maintain
- Cross-database consistency challenges
- Complex backup and recovery procedures
- Different query languages (SQL vs InfluxQL)
- Higher operational complexity
```

#### Option B: MongoDB + InfluxDB
```
Architecture:
- MongoDB for document-based transactional data
- InfluxDB for time-series data

Pros:
- Flexible document model
- Good horizontal scaling
- Purpose-built time-series database

Cons:
- No ACID transactions across collections
- Two database systems to maintain
- Limited SQL compatibility
- Complex consistency management
```

#### Option C: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB (Selected)
```
Architecture:
- PostgreSQL for all transactional data
- TimescaleDB extension for time-series optimization
- Single database with dual capabilities

Pros:
- Single database system to maintain
- Full ACID compliance for financial data
- SQL interface for all queries
- Relational joins between transactional and time-series data
- Mature ecosystem and tooling
- Simplified backup and recovery

Cons:
- May not match pure time-series database performance
- Single database scaling challenges
```

### Decision Rationale

**Financial Data Requirements**:
```sql
-- ACID compliance essential for financial transactions
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO orders (user_id, symbol, quantity, price) VALUES (...);
UPDATE account_balances SET balance = balance - :cost WHERE account_id = :id;
INSERT INTO audit_log (action, details) VALUES ('order_created', :details);
COMMIT;
```

**Operational Simplicity**:
```yaml
# Single database backup strategy
backup_strategy:
  - pg_dump for transactional data
  - Time-series data included in same backup
  - Single restore procedure
  - Consistent point-in-time recovery
```

**Query Flexibility**:
```sql
-- Complex queries joining transactional and time-series data
SELECT 
    u.username,
    o.order_id,
    ps.timestamp,
    ps.total_pnl
FROM users u
JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id  
JOIN portfolio_snapshots ps ON u.id = ps.user_id
WHERE ps.timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
    AND o.status = 'filled';
```

### Performance Analysis

**TimescaleDB Optimizations**:
```sql
-- Hypertable creation for time-series optimization
SELECT create_hypertable('portfolio_snapshots', 'time', 'user_id', 4);

-- Automatic partitioning by time and space
-- Compression for historical data
-- Continuous aggregates for real-time analytics
```

**Benchmark Results** (Internal Testing):
```
Operation                | PostgreSQL | TimescaleDB | InfluxDB
------------------------|------------|-------------|----------
Transactional Inserts   | 50K/sec    | 50K/sec     | N/A
Time-series Inserts     | 10K/sec    | 100K/sec    | 150K/sec
Complex Queries         | Fast       | Fast        | Limited
ACID Compliance         | Full       | Full        | Partial
Operational Complexity  | Low        | Low         | High
```

### Implementation Strategy

**Database Schema Design**:
```sql
-- Transactional tables (standard PostgreSQL)
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    telegram_id BIGINT UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Time-series tables (TimescaleDB hypertables)
CREATE TABLE portfolio_snapshots (
    time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    total_balance DECIMAL(18,2),
    unrealized_pnl DECIMAL(18,2)
);

-- Convert to hypertable
SELECT create_hypertable('portfolio_snapshots', 'time', 'user_id', 4);
```

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Single database system reduces operational complexity
- Full ACID compliance for financial data integrity
- SQL interface for all queries simplifies development
- Strong ecosystem and community support
- Cost-effective solution

**Negative**:
- May not achieve peak time-series database performance
- Single database may become bottleneck at extreme scale
- Learning curve for TimescaleDB-specific features

**Future Considerations**:
- Monitor performance at scale
- Consider read replicas for query scaling
- Evaluate sharding strategies if needed
- Keep option open for specialized time-series database if requirements change

## ADR-005: WebSocket Architecture for Market Data

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: September 2025  
**Deciders**: Solution Architecture Team, Trading Team  

### Context
The system needs real-time market data from multiple exchanges while avoiding API rate limit exhaustion and minimizing connection overhead. Different types of data (market data vs account data) have different sharing requirements.

### Decision
Implement **Dual WebSocket Architecture** with shared connections for market data and individual connections for private account data.

### Alternatives Considered

#### Option A: Individual Connections Per User
```
Architecture: Each user gets dedicated WebSocket connections

Pros:
- Simple connection management
- Complete data isolation
- Easy to implement per-user features

Cons:
- Massive API rate limit consumption
- High connection overhead (100 users Ã— 2 exchanges = 200+ connections)
- Duplicated market data bandwidth
- Exchange connection limits may be exceeded
```

#### Option B: Single Shared Connection for All Data
```
Architecture: One WebSocket connection per exchange for all data types

Pros:
- Minimal connection overhead
- Maximum rate limit efficiency
- Simple infrastructure

Cons:
- Security risks mixing public and private data
- Complex authentication management
- Difficult to handle user-specific private data
- Single point of failure for all users
```

#### Option C: Dual WebSocket Architecture (Selected)
```
Architecture: 
- Shared connections for public market data
- Individual connections for private account data

Pros:
- Optimal rate limit usage for market data
- Secure isolation of private account data
- Scalable connection management
- Clear separation of concerns

Cons:
- More complex connection management logic
- Two different WebSocket handling patterns
```

### Decision Rationale

**Rate Limit Analysis**:
```yaml
Exchange Rate Limits:
  Binance: 300 connections per IP
  Bybit: 200 connections per IP
  
Individual Connection Approach:
  100 users Ã— 2 exchanges = 200 connections (near limit)
  Market data duplicated 100 times
  
Dual Architecture Approach:
  Market data: 2 shared connections (1 per exchange)
  Account data: 200 individual connections (100 users Ã— 2 exchanges)
  Total: 202 connections
  Market data shared across all users
```

**Data Flow Optimization**:
```python
# Market Data Service (Shared)
class MarketDataService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.shared_connections = {}  # exchange -> WebSocket
        self.subscriptions = {}       # symbol -> set(subscriber_ids)
    
    async def subscribe_symbol(self, exchange: str, symbol: str, subscriber_id: str):
        """Subscribe to symbol with connection sharing"""
        connection_key = f"{exchange}:{symbol}"
        
        if connection_key not in self.shared_connections:
            # Create single shared connection
            ws = await self.create_market_websocket(exchange, [symbol])
            self.shared_connections[connection_key] = ws
            
        # Add subscriber to shared connection
        if symbol not in self.subscriptions:
            self.subscriptions[symbol] = set()
        self.subscriptions[symbol].add(subscriber_id)

# Account Data Service (Individual)
class AccountDataService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.account_connections = {}  # account_id -> WebSocket
    
    async def connect_account(self, user_id: str, account_id: str, credentials):
        """Create individual authenticated connection"""
        ws = await self.create_account_websocket(credentials)
        self.account_connections[account_id] = ws
```

**Security Considerations**:
```yaml
Market Data (Public):
  - No authentication required
  - Safe to share across users
  - Read-only data
  - No privacy concerns
  
Account Data (Private):
  - Requires API key authentication
  - Contains sensitive balance/position data
  - Must be isolated per user
  - Privacy and security critical
```

### Implementation Strategy

**Connection Management**:
```python
class WebSocketConnectionManager:
    """Manages both shared and individual WebSocket connections"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.market_data_service = MarketDataService()
        self.account_data_service = AccountDataService()
        self.connection_health_monitor = ConnectionHealthMonitor()
    
    async def initialize_user_connections(self, user_id: str, accounts: List[Account]):
        """Initialize all connections for a user"""
        
        # Individual account connections
        for account in accounts:
            await self.account_data_service.connect_account(
                user_id=user_id,
                account_id=account.id,
                credentials=account.api_credentials
            )
        
        # Subscribe to shared market data for user's symbols
        user_symbols = await self.get_user_trading_symbols(user_id)
        for symbol in user_symbols:
            await self.market_data_service.subscribe_symbol(
                exchange=account.exchange,
                symbol=symbol,
                subscriber_id=user_id
            )
    
    async def cleanup_user_connections(self, user_id: str):
        """Clean up connections when user disconnects"""
        
        # Remove from shared market data subscriptions
        await self.market_data_service.unsubscribe_user(user_id)
        
        # Close individual account connections
        await self.account_data_service.disconnect_user(user_id)
```

**Data Distribution**:
```python
class DataDistributionService:
    """Distributes data from WebSocket connections to appropriate services"""
    
    async def handle_market_data(self, exchange: str, symbol: str, data: dict):
        """Handle shared market data and distribute to subscribers"""
        
        # Normalize data format
        normalized_data = self.normalize_market_data(exchange, data)
        
        # Publish to Kafka for all subscribers
        await self.kafka_producer.send(
            topic="market.data.prices",
            key=symbol,
            value=normalized_data
        )
        
        # Update Redis cache
        await self.redis.setex(
            f"price:{symbol}",
            30,  # 30 second TTL
            json.dumps(normalized_data)
        )
    
    async def handle_account_data(self, account_id: str, data: dict):
        """Handle individual account data"""
        
        # Parse account-specific update
        update_type = self.identify_account_update_type(data)
        
        if update_type == "BALANCE_UPDATE":
            await self.handle_balance_update(account_id, data)
        elif update_type == "POSITION_UPDATE":
            await self.handle_position_update(account_id, data)
        elif update_type == "ORDER_UPDATE":
            await self.handle_order_update(account_id, data)
```

### Performance Monitoring

**Connection Health Tracking**:
```python
class ConnectionHealthMonitor:
    """Monitor health of WebSocket connections"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.health_metrics = {
            'market_connections': {},
            'account_connections': {},
            'last_message_times': {}
        }
    
    async def monitor_connections(self):
        """Periodic health check of all connections"""
        while True:
            # Check shared market connections
            for exchange, connection in self.market_data_service.shared_connections.items():
                if not connection.is_connected:
                    await self.reconnect_market_data(exchange)
                
                # Check message freshness
                last_message = self.last_message_times.get(exchange)
                if last_message and (datetime.utcnow() - last_message).seconds > 60:
                    logger.warning(f"No market data from {exchange} for 60+ seconds")
            
            # Check individual account connections
            for account_id, connection in self.account_data_service.account_connections.items():
                if not connection.is_connected:
                    await self.reconnect_account_data(account_id)
            
            await asyncio.sleep(30)  # Check every 30 seconds
```

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Optimal use of exchange rate limits
- Secure isolation of private data
- Scalable architecture for many users  
- Clear separation of public vs private data concerns
- Efficient bandwidth usage

**Negative**:
- More complex connection management
- Two different WebSocket handling patterns
- Additional coordination between services
- More failure modes to handle

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive connection health monitoring
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Clear error handling and logging
- Circuit breaker patterns for external connections
- Fallback mechanisms for connection failures

### Decision Rationale

**Performance Analysis**:
```yaml
Benchmark Results (requests/second):
  Go + Gin: 40,000
  Java + Spring Boot: 35,000
  Python + FastAPI: 25,000
  Node.js + Fastify: 30,000

Trading System Requirements:
  Target: 10,000 requests/second
  FastAPI Performance: 25,000 requests/second (2.5x headroom)
  Conclusion: Performance adequate with room for growth
```

**Ecosystem Advantages**:
```python
# Financial computing libraries
import pandas as pd           # Data manipulation
import numpy as np           # Numerical computing
import ccxt                  # Cryptocurrency exchange integration
import TA_lib                # Technical analysis
import asyncpg               # Async PostgreSQL driver
import aioredis              # Async Redis client

# FastAPI advantages
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
import asyncio

# Automatic API documentation, request validation, async support
class OrderRequest(BaseModel):
    symbol: str
    quantity: float
    price: float = None
    
app = FastAPI()  # Auto-generates OpenAPI docs

@app.post("/orders")
async def create_order(request: OrderRequest):  # Type validation automatic
    # Async processing
    return await process_order(request)
```

**Development Velocity**:
```yaml
Code Examples Comparison:

Go (Verbose):
  type OrderRequest struct {
    Symbol   string  `json:"symbol" validate:"required"`
    Quantity float64 `json:"quantity" validate:"min=0.01"`
    Price    *float64 `json:"price,omitempty"`
  }
  
Python (Concise):
  class OrderRequest(BaseModel):
    symbol: str
    quantity: float = Field(gt=0.01)
    price: Optional[float] = None

Lines of Code Estimate:
  Python: 100 lines
  Go: 150 lines  
  Java: 200 lines
```

```

**Code Quality Standards**:
```python
# Type hints mandatory
from typing import Optional, List, Dict, Any
from uuid import UUID
from decimal import Decimal

async def create_order(
    user_id: UUID,
    symbol: str,
    quantity: Decimal,
    price: Optional[Decimal] = None
) -> Order:
    """Create new trading order with full type safety"""
    pass

# Pydantic for data validation
class OrderRequest(BaseModel):
    symbol: str = Field(..., regex=r'^[A-Z]{3,10}USDT$')
    quantity: Decimal = Field(..., gt=0, decimal_places=8)
    price: Optional[Decimal] = Field(None, gt=0, decimal_places=2)
    
    class Config:
        validate_assignment = True
        use_enum_values = True
```

**Performance Optimizations**:
```python
# Async database connections
import asyncpg
from asyncpg.pool import Pool

class DatabaseManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pool: Optional[Pool] = None
    
    async def initialize(self):
        self.pool = await asyncpg.create_pool(
            dsn=DATABASE_URL,
            min_size=10,
            max_size=20,
            command_timeout=60
        )

# Async Kafka integration
from aiokafka import AIOKafkaProducer, AIOKafkaConsumer

class EventPublisher:
    def __init__(self):
        self.producer = AIOKafkaProducer(
            bootstrap_servers='kafka:9092',
            compression_type='snappy'
        )
```

### Testing Strategy

**Testing Framework**:
```python
# pytest-asyncio for async testing
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient
from main import app

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_create_order():
    async with AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://test") as ac:
        response = await ac.post("/orders", json={
            "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
            "quantity": "0.001",
            "price": "50000.00"
        })
    assert response.status_code == 201

# Factory pattern for test data
import factory
from models import Order

class OrderFactory(factory.Factory):
    class Meta:
        model = Order
    
    symbol = "BTCUSDT"
    quantity = factory.Faker('pydecimal', left_digits=5, right_digits=8, positive=True)
```

### Consequences

**Positive**:
