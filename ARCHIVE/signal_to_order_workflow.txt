PATRIOT Trading System: Signal to Order Workflow Analysis
========================================================

1. Signal Reception
-------------------
- Trading signal received from API (direction, entry price, stop loss, take profit, etc.)
- Signal is processed and validated.
- Telegram notification sent with signal details.

2. Limit Order Placement
------------------------
- If signal is valid, limit order is placed at entry price.
- If a previous limit order exists and new signal price is better, previous order is canceled and new limit order is placed.
- Telegram notification sent about order cancellation and new order placement.
- Multiple orders allowed if previous limit order is executed and new signal price is better than executed order.

3. Limit Order Execution
------------------------
- (ISSUE) No message is sent when limit order is executed.
- (ISSUE) No stop loss or take profit order is placed after limit order execution.

4. Stop Loss & Take Profit Orders
---------------------------------
- (EXPECTED) After limit order execution, stop loss and take profit orders should be placed (OCO logic).
- (ISSUE) These orders are not being set after limit order execution.
- Need to verify if OCO logic is implemented and triggered correctly after limit order execution.

5. Order Follow-ups & Settlements
---------------------------------
- System should monitor order status and send follow-up messages (executed, canceled, failed, etc.).
- Telegram notifications should reflect all key events (order execution, stop/take triggered, etc.).

What Works Fine
---------------
- Canceling and setting new limit order if new signal price is better than previous limit order price.
- Reporting of such events to Telegram.
- Multiple orders allowed if previous limit order is executed and new limit order price is better than previously executed order.

Key Issues to Investigate
-------------------------
1. Why are limit order execution messages not sent?
2. Why are stop loss and take profit orders not set after limit order execution?
3. Is OCO logic implemented and triggered after limit order execution?
4. Are all order events (execution, stop/take, cancellation) reported to Telegram?

Action Plan (Project Manager Lead)
----------------------------------
- Review order execution handler logic for missing Telegram notifications.
- Audit post-limit-order-execution workflow to ensure stop loss and take profit orders are created.
- Validate OCO logic implementation and triggering after limit order execution.
- Ensure all order events are logged and reported to Telegram.
- Assign responsible developers to investigate and fix each issue.
- Schedule workflow tests and monitor for correct event reporting and order handling.
