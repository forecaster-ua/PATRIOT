Detailed Bugfix Roadmap
======================

1. Analyze Order Execution Handler
   - Locate the code responsible for handling limit order executions.
   - Check if there is a callback/event for successful execution.
   - Ensure Telegram notification is sent when a limit order is executed.

2. Implement Stop Loss & Take Profit After Limit Execution
   - Verify if stop loss and take profit orders are created after limit order execution.
   - If missing, add logic to create these orders immediately after execution.
   - Ensure OCO (One Cancels Other) logic is applied for these orders.

3. Audit OCO Logic
   - Review OCO implementation for stop/take orders.
   - Confirm OCO is triggered only after limit order execution, not before.
   - Add logging and Telegram reporting for OCO events (triggered/canceled).

4. Improve Telegram Reporting
   - Ensure all order events (execution, stop/take, cancellation, OCO triggers) are reported to Telegram.
   - Standardize message formats for clarity.
   - Add error handling and fallback notifications for failed order actions.

5. Test and Monitor
   - Write unit/integration tests for the full workflow.
   - Simulate various scenarios (limit execution, OCO triggers, cancellations).
   - Monitor logs and Telegram for correct event reporting.

6. Documentation & Knowledge Sharing
   - Update this file with findings, fixes, and workflow changes.
   - Share results and best practices with the team.

First Step to Execution
=======================

Start with Step 1: Analyze Order Execution Handler
- Find the function/class/module that processes limit order executions.
- Add debug logging to confirm when and how limit order executions are detected.
- Document the current flow in this file before making changes.
